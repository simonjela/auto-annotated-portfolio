Imagine a musical séance where Harry Styles, The Weeknd, and the legendary spirits of Toto, Chicago, and Santana come together—Simon Jela’s sound is what they’d leave behind. In 2023, the winner of the Hessian MKK Cultural Award made the move to Berlin—not to chase clichés, but to carve his own path. Fueled by the city’s rich history, diverse music scene, and boundless creative energy, he set out to push his artistry further through bold collaborations and fearless experimentation.

Like Berlin itself, Simon Jela’s music is layered, full of contrasts, and bursting with life. His songs are an emotional kaleidoscope—reckless energy and carefree euphoria collide with moments of vulnerability and introspective stillness. He weaves memories of love lost and nights fading into darkness with electrifying beats, capturing the feeling of dancing through the city’s streets, only to lose yourself in the pulse of its legendary clubs.
