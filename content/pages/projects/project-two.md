Whether summer, autumn, winter, or spring – with his EP ‘Tequila’ Simon Jela mixes the perfect cocktail for every season. Summer heat, autumn melancholy, and the thrill of spring – sometimes light and carefree, sometimes deep and melancholic – the five songs on the EP capture the full cycle of the seasons. Each track is a moment to savor, like the freshness of a spring morning, the ease of a summer day, the contemplation of an autumn evening, or the depth of a winter night. ‘Tequila’ isn’t just a summer hit; it’s a musical journey that celebrates all facets of life. On November 29, this journey reaches its peak – intense, moving, and full of unexpected twists.

Tastes like sea salt and lemon, sounds like dancing, and leaves a bittersweet aftertaste of summer nights that pass all too quickly. With his latest track ‘Tequila’ Simon Jela also serves us his new EP ‘Tequila’ – a musical cocktail that not only gets your hips moving but also takes your soul on a journey. Not pop from stiff genre boxes – ‘Tequila’ is the soundtrack for anyone floating between self-discovery, longing, and the fleeting magic of life. Five tracks that flow and fuse as passionately as a hot dance at a sweaty beach party, except now the dance floor is your living room – or maybe your heart.

The title track is called ‘Tequila’ and is inspired by the rhythms of Carlos Santana. Don’t think of the dim corner bar but rather a tropical beach bar, with the sun just setting and the Latin-infused rhythms so seductive that you forget your daily worries – or at least let them go for a moment. It’s about the play between closeness and distance, capturing fleeting moments, the desire that comes and goes as naturally as the tides. It is a song that brings summer, seduction, and passion – not grand love, but perhaps a sweet night of intense closeness. Ryan Nasci (Harry Styles, Portugal. The Man, The Head And The Heart, Bülow, Lykke Li) in LA, USA, gave the song a unique touch in production, and newcomer Christoph Oswald in Mannheim, Germany, produced it to feel like the rhythm of a crowded dance floor, inevitably pulling you into motion.

But ‘Tequila’ is more than just a hot summer track for cold winter days. On his EP, Simon Jela effortlessly merges pop, R\&B, rock, Latin beats, and dance, revealing a different side of himself in each of the five tracks. Sometimes introspective and gentle, sometimes energetic and captivating.

Whether you’re searching for summer in the winter or getting lost in the heartfelt lyrics – this EP makes you feel on the same wavelength as the artist. Because Simon stays true to himself: ‘Music is my safe space to express my thoughts and feelings unfiltered.’ And you can feel that. In every note, every beat, every word. And as a little bonus, there’s an unreleased track, ‘Light It Up,’ which will grab you in its own way…

Ready for a taste of summer in winter?
‘Tequila’ is waiting for you!
